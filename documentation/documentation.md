Dysphonia measurements refer to a set of vocal features or measurements that are used to assess and characterize voice disorders, particularly dysphonia. Dysphonia is a medical term that refers to difficulty or impairment in voice production, often resulting in changes in voice quality, pitch, loudness, or resonance. Dysphonia measurements are used in clinical settings to diagnose voice disorders, monitor treatment progress, and evaluate voice rehabilitation outcomes.
